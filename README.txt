 * This program creates a user interface that displays the preview images of four movie
 * posters (all obtained via Google Images). When hovered over an image, it displays the
 * movie's title and the image's URL. Each image acts as a button; when pressed,
 * a new window opens and displays the selected image as well as all of its available
 * metadata. When the secondary window (that of which contains the metadata) is closed,
 * the main window (the user interface) remains open, and the user may select any image
 * for as many times as desired until the user exits the main window.
